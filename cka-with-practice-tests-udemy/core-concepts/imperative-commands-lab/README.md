In this lab, you will get hands-on practice with creating Kubernetes objects imperatively. All the questions in this lab can be done imperatively.
However, for some questions, you may need to first create the YAML file using imperative methods.
You can then modify the YAML according to the need and create the object using kubectl apply -f command.
